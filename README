TINYCARD

tinycard is a library to help you write web applications for The Spoils TCG.
If you need to put a large number (10-100) of cards on the screen for the user
to see, you need to present them in a way that's both very area-efficient and
very readable. tinycard provides that for you.

HOW TO USE IT

Make sure your page includes the tinycard CSS file, and that the imgs
directory is accessible for a user browsing your page. Include the
tinycard JavaScript file, and invoke it through the tinycard function.

EXAMPLE

example.html provides an example page demonstrating the use of tinycard.
example.jpg shows what it should look like.

NOTES

Although the example page uses jQuery, the tinycard library itself is written
in vanilla JavaScript and will therefore work with any JavaScript library.
